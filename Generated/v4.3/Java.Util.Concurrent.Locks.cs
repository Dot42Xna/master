		/// <para>A <code>ReadWriteLock</code> maintains a pair of associated locks, one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads, so long as there are no writers. The write lock is exclusive.</para><para>All <code>ReadWriteLock</code> implementations must guarantee that the memory synchronization effects of <code>writeLock</code> operations (as specified in the Lock interface) also hold with respect to the associated <code>readLock</code>. That is, a thread successfully acquiring the read lock will see all updates made upon previous release of the write lock.</para><para>A read-write lock allows for a greater level of concurrency in accessing shared data than that permitted by a mutual exclusion lock. It exploits the fact that while only a single thread at a time (a <b>writer</b> thread) can modify the shared data, in many cases any number of threads can concurrently read the data (hence <b>reader</b> threads). In theory, the increase in concurrency permitted by the use of a read-write lock will lead to performance improvements over the use of a mutual exclusion lock. In practice this increase in concurrency will only be fully realized on a multi-processor, and then only if the access patterns for the shared data are suitable.</para><para>Whether or not a read-write lock will improve performance over the use of a mutual exclusion lock depends on the frequency that the data is read compared to being modified, the duration of the read and write operations, and the contention for the data - that is, the number of threads that will try to read or write the data at the same time. For example, a collection that is initially populated with data and thereafter infrequently modified, while being frequently searched (such as a directory of some kind) is an ideal candidate for the use of a read-write lock. However, if updates become frequent then the data spends most of its time being exclusively locked and there is little, if any increase in concurrency. Further, if the read operations are too short the overhead of the read-write lock implementation (which is inherently more complex than a mutual exclusion lock) can dominate the execution cost, particularly as many read-write lock implementations still serialize all threads through a small section of code. Ultimately, only profiling and measurement will establish whether the use of a read-write lock is suitable for your application.</para><para>Although the basic operation of a read-write lock is straight-forward, there are many policy decisions that an implementation must make, which may affect the effectiveness of the read-write lock in a given application. Examples of these policies include: <ul><li><para>Determining whether to grant the read lock or the write lock, when both readers and writers are waiting, at the time that a writer releases the write lock. Writer preference is common, as writes are expected to be short and infrequent. Reader preference is less common as it can lead to lengthy delays for a write if the readers are frequent and long-lived as expected. Fair, or "in-order" implementations are also possible.</para><para></para></li><li><para>Determining whether readers that request the read lock while a reader is active and a writer is waiting, are granted the read lock. Preference to the reader can delay the writer indefinitely, while preference to the writer can reduce the potential for concurrency.</para><para></para></li><li><para>Determining whether the locks are reentrant: can a thread with the write lock reacquire it? Can it acquire a read lock while holding the write lock? Is the read lock itself reentrant?</para><para></para></li><li><para>Can the write lock be downgraded to a read lock without allowing an intervening writer? Can a read lock be upgraded to a write lock, in preference to other waiting readers or writers?</para><para></para></li></ul>You should consider all of these things when evaluating the suitability of a given implementation for your application.</para><para><para>ReentrantReadWriteLock </para><simplesectsep></simplesectsep><para>Lock </para><simplesectsep></simplesectsep><para>ReentrantLock</para><para>1.5 </para><para>Doug Lea </para></para>

		/// <summary>
		/// <para>Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues. This class is designed to be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a single atomic <code>int</code> value to represent state. Subclasses must define the protected methods that change this state, and which define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired or released. Given these, the other methods in this class carry out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain other state fields, but only the atomically updated <code>int</code> value manipulated using methods getState, setState and compareAndSetState is tracked with respect to synchronization.</para><para>Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties of their enclosing class. Class <code>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</code> does not implement any synchronization interface. Instead it defines methods such as acquireInterruptibly that can be invoked as appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to implement their public methods.</para><para>This class supports either or both a default <b>exclusive</b> mode and a <b>shared</b> mode. When acquired in exclusive mode, attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class does not "understand" these differences except in the mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a ReadWriteLock. Subclasses that support only exclusive or only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.</para><para>This class defines a nested ConditionObject class that can be used as a Condition implementation by subclasses supporting exclusive mode for which method isHeldExclusively reports whether synchronization is exclusively held with respect to the current thread, method release invoked with the current getState value fully releases this object, and acquire, given this saved state value, eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state. No <code>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</code> method otherwise creates such a condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it. The behavior of ConditionObject depends of course on the semantics of its synchronizer implementation.</para><para>This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes using an <code>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</code> for their synchronization mechanics.</para><para>Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will define a <code>readObject</code> method that restores this to a known initial state upon deserialization.</para><para><h3>Usage</h3></para><para>To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying the synchronization state using getState, setState and/or compareAndSetState:</para><para><ul><li><para>tryAcquire </para></li><li><para>tryRelease </para></li><li><para>tryAcquireShared </para></li><li><para>tryReleaseShared </para></li><li><para>isHeldExclusively </para></li></ul></para><para>Each of these methods by default throws UnsupportedOperationException. Implementations of these methods must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and not block. Defining these methods is the <b>only</b> supported means of using this class. All other methods are declared <code>final</code> because they cannot be independently varied.</para><para>You may also find the inherited methods from AbstractOwnableSynchronizer useful to keep track of the thread owning an exclusive synchronizer. You are encouraged to use them  this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in determining which threads hold locks.</para><para>Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies. The core of exclusive synchronization takes the form:</para><para><pre>
		///    Acquire:
		///        while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
		///           <b>enqueue thread if it is not already queued</b>;
		///           <b>possibly block current thread</b>;
		///        }
		/// 
		///    Release:
		///        if (tryRelease(arg))
		///           <b>unblock the first queued thread</b>;
		///    </pre></para><para>(Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)</para><para>Because checks in acquire are invoked before enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may <b>barge</b> ahead of others that are blocked and queued. However, you can, if desired, define <code>tryAcquire</code> and/or <code>tryAcquireShared</code> to disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection methods. In particular, a strict FIFO lock can define <code>tryAcquire</code> to immediately return <code>false</code> if getFirstQueuedThread does not return the current thread. A normally preferable non-strict fair version can immediately return <code>false</code> only if hasQueuedThreads returns <code>true</code> and <code>getFirstQueuedThread</code> is not the current thread; or equivalently, that <code>getFirstQueuedThread</code> is both non-null and not the current thread. Further variations are possible.</para><para>Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as <b>greedy</b>, <b>renouncement</b>, and <b>convoy-avoidance</b>) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not "spin" in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of <code>tryAcquire</code> interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking hasContended and/or hasQueuedThreads to only do so if the synchronizer is likely not to be contended.</para><para>This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to synchronizers that can rely on <code>int</code> state, acquire, and release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using atomic classes, your own custom java.util.Queue classes, and LockSupport blocking support.</para><para><h3>Usage Examples</h3></para><para>Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock does not strictly require recording of the current owner thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor. It also supports conditions and exposes one of the instrumentation methods:</para><para><pre>    class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {

They allow more flexible structuring, may have quite different properties, and may support multiple associated Condition objects.</para><para>A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to a shared resource, such as the read lock of a ReadWriteLock.</para><para>The use of <c> synchronized </c> methods or statements provides access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way: when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which they were acquired.</para><para>While the scoping mechanism for <c> synchronized </c> methods and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks, and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks, there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing concurrently accessed data structures require the use of "hand-over-hand" or "chain locking": you acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire C, then release B and acquire D and so on. Implementations of the <c> Lock </c> interface enable the use of such techniques by allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes, and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any order.</para><para>With this increased flexibility comes additional responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with <c> synchronized </c> methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom should be used:</para><para><pre>    Lock l = ...;
		/// 
		///    l.lock();
		/// 
		///    try {
		/// 
		///      // access the resource protected by this lock
		/// 
		///    } finally {
		/// 
		///      l.unlock();
		/// 
		///    } 
		/// 
		///  </pre></para><para>When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the lock is released when necessary.</para><para><c> Lock </c> implementations provide additional functionality over the use of <c> synchronized </c> methods and statements by providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock (tryLock()), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be interrupted (lockInterruptibly, and an attempt to acquire the lock that can timeout (tryLock(long, TimeUnit)).</para><para>A <c> Lock </c> class can also provide behavior and semantics that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock, such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.</para><para>Note that <c> Lock </c> instances are just normal objects and can themselves be used as the target in a <c> synchronized </c> statement. Acquiring the monitor lock of a <c> Lock </c> instance has no specified relationship with invoking any of the lock methods of that instance. It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use <c> Lock </c> instances in this way, except within their own implementation.</para><para>Except where noted, passing a <c> null </c> value for any parameter will result in a NullPointerException being thrown.</para><para><h3>Memory Synchronization</h3></para><para>All <c> Lock </c> implementations <b>must</b> enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in : <ul><li><para>A successful <c> lock </c> operation has the same memory synchronization effects as a successful <b>Lock</b> action. </para></li><li><para>A successful <c> unlock </c> operation has the same memory synchronization effects as a successful <b>Unlock</b> action. </para></li></ul></para><para>Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory synchronization effects.</para><para><h3>Implementation Considerations</h3></para><para>The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation qualities. Further, the ability to interrupt the <b>ongoing</b> acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given <c> Lock </c> class. Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an ongoing lock acquisition. An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on method entry.</para><para>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.</para><para><para>ReentrantLock </para><simplesectsep></simplesectsep><para>Condition </para><simplesectsep></simplesectsep><para>ReadWriteLock</para><para>1.5 </para><para>Doug Lea </para></para>
